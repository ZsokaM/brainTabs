# BrainTabs

## What is BrainTabs?

BrainTabs is an app that allows you to make notes (for example while you are learning webdev and need a cheatsheet for all those git commands) and it also provides a platform to keep track of the articles, podcasts, websites, books etc. that you come across and want to store for later.

## Why BrainTabs?

I've built this app within the realms of the Ironhack bootcamp. The assignment was to build a webapp that demonstrates what we learned so far about the "main ingredients", authentication, databases and CRUD. All clear, but I needed a topic that's _"close to home"_. The past 4 months an insane amount of information is being uploaded to our brains and in order to actually keep this info, I've been taking notes, collected resources, 3 youtube videos are playing at all times, have approx 25 tabs open constantly with useful snippets and articles with the hope that the chaos will somehow magically get organized.
So I thought to myself, _why not build an app that allows me to gather/compile all this in one place_. You must be thinking, _Zsoka, you do know these apps already exist right?_ and yes, of course, but why not have a little fun trying to replicate the basics?

## The main ingredients

You can see the full list of dependencies in the json.package but here is a list of the main ingredients:

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB and mongoose
- Passport
- bcrypt
- HTML & CSS
- Handlebars

#### I'd like to highlight two cool APIs used for the project

- [tiny](https://www.tiny.cloud/) for text editing
- [LinkPreview](https://www.linkpreview.net/) for fetching URL info in JSON

and lets not forget to mention [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and [coolors](https://coolors.co/) for their cool libraries.

## Disclaimer

Not compatible with mobile devices. Only tested on Chrome, Safari.

## Features for the future

If I'd continue this project, these are some of the features I'd dedicate time to:

- proper design
- dynamic tags input fields
- search by keyword
- link saving functionality within the note taking view so you can reference resources easier
- paper style editing (flowing text, no separate page for editing)
- sharing functionality and multiple collaborators
